* Working notes

Here we do the actual work.

** Renat
*** Brainstorm/Braindump
    - The final task is to have an article offering an opinionated
      list of building blocks implementing CODE methodology.

    - I want to concentrate on
      - Search
      - Highlighting
      - Summarization

    - We may want to make a set of videos/gifs demonstrating workflow
      with our instrument.

    - Don't hesitate to use brute force

*** Useful links
A list of useful packages for implementing CODE with Emacs.

- [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HighlightLibrary][EmacsWiki: Highlight Library]]
  Highlight the text.

- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Enriched-Text.html][Emacs Enriched Text mode]]
  Persistently store highlights and Emacs markup in text files.

- [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc - About pandoc]]
  Transform various documents to org-mode format.

*** Capture

    Web-pages
    - pandoc

    Images
    - test google cloud vision api
    - rekognition api
      I ended up using rekognition API

      You need amazon account to use it.
      #+caption: Rekognition script
      #+begin_src bash
        #!/bin/bash

        set -euo pipefail

        CREDENTIALS="$1"
        TARGET_BASENAME="$(basename "$2")"

        docker run --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v /home/renat/.aws:/tmp/.aws -e HOME=/tmp -v "$(realpath "$2"):/mnt/$TARGET_BASENAME" -w /mnt --rm -i amazon/aws-cli --profile "$CREDENTIALS" rekognition detect-labels --image-bytes "fileb://$TARGET_BASENAME"
      #+end_src

*** Organize

    Tagging your notes as PARA objects.

    I have two approaches to manage projects, areas and resource tags:
    by roam tags and by roam links.

**** Tags

     For every note you assign an appropriate tag with
     =org-roam-tag-add=.

     Then you can see all of your projects for example just by
     searching by project tag.


     On roam v2 it will look like.

     #+DOWNLOADED: screenshot @ 2021-06-09 09:16:32
     #+attr_org: :width 400px
     [[file:Working_notes/2021-06-09_09-16-32_screenshot.png]]


**** Roam linkns

     You create roam fiels named =Project=, =Area=, =Resource= and
     then put it into a roam entry as a link.

     Then, you open the =Areas= note and in your org-roam buffer you
     will see:

  Here will go the actual content we produce.

  Prerequisites:

  - [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][GitHub - org-roam/org-roam: Rudimentary Roam replica with Org-mode]]

    This guide uses org-roam as the central tool to manage your notes.
    And this is the only prerequisite.

    Use a guide to set up either V1 or V2 version of org-roam.

*** ripgrep (helm-rg)
[[https://github.com/cosmicexplorer/helm-rg][GitHub - cosmicexplorer/helm-rg: ripgrep is nice]]
Now I use it as a default text search engine.

*** helm-org-rifle
[[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-rifle][GitHub - alphapapa/org-rifle: Rifle through your Org-mode buffers and acquire your target]]

This one is good. It gives you an idea about the context. But it's not ordering the data by the highlights.
=(helm-org-rifle-directories org-roam-directory)=

I find org-rifle too slow at the moment. But its output is exacly what I want.
*** deft
[[https://github.com/dfeich/helm-deft][GitHub - dfeich/helm-deft: A helm based emacs module to help search in a predetermined list of directories. Inspired by the deft module.]]

I use helm implementation. Speed is fast enough.

*** org-ql
[[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql][GitHub - alphapapa/org-ql: An Org-mode query language, including search commands and saved views]]

Doesn't look suitable for large filesets.

*** recoll
[[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm-recoll][GitHub - emacs-helm/helm-recoll: helm interface for the recoll desktop search tool.]]
I found recoll being to hard to set up.
I wasn't able to get it working on MacOS.

*** org-fts
[[https://github.com/zot/microfts/tree/main/elisp][microfts/elisp at main · zot/microfts · GitHub]]

- It didn't work on MacOS from scratch.
- I tried to compile its binary manually but that didn't work
  either.
- This one looks promising. Let's keep an eye on it.

*** org-agenda search
- Not trying this for now because agenda wants to open all its
  files for search.

* Awesome Emacs Code
